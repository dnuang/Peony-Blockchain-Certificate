# Peony
A multi-purposes certificate contract platform on ethereum 

- Problems to solve: People might lie about having certificates. Also, schools, governments or any entity want to mitigate fraudulent certificates. We create a platform allowing schools or governments to issue certificates, making the certificates credible in a transparent and frad-preventing way.

- Platform will be called as Peony
- Token will be named "Petal"  with symbol of "PTL"
    - TA mentioned Non-fungible tokens, we can also treat the certificate as tokens depending on the contract

- If you're having problem on testing the project on browser...
Make sure you're MetaMask is running on same port number (Ganache: 7454)
